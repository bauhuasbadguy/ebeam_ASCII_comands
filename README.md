ebeam_ASCII_comands
===================

Programs to produce ASCII commands to be read by ebeam

What's here now
----------------

This repositry contains a module file *(ASCIIwriter.py)* and an example file using said module 
*(ringsASCIIfilewriter.py)* and a example output file *(17814ringsdosetest.txt)*.

Future developments
--------------------

As well as the functions producing the lines as an output there will be functions that write the lines themselves.
There will also be functions that draw the results so you can check that you've done the right thing on the fly.
